# Lab-29: Django Custom User
## Overview
Django does a great job at allowing to get started with a solid foundation. But a foundation is just the beginning. We still need to "build the house."

One of the first things many developers need to do is have a custom user.

For this lab you'll build your application from the very beginning with a Custom User model.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
* create Django application from scratch that has a custom user model named CustomUser
* Custom user should use email instead of username for signup / login
* Application should work with Django Admin
## Implementation Notes:
* Make sure to create custom user model before migrating data
* User Acceptance Tests
* Verify the creation of a new user with email and password
* Verify that duplicate emails are not allowed
## Configuration
Use poetry to initialize django-custom-user project.
```
> $ mkdir django-custom-user
> $ cd django-custom-user
> $ poetry init -n
```

* Use the folder created by Poetry as the root of your project's git repository.
* Refer to Lab Submission Instructions{:target="_blank"} for detailed instructions.
